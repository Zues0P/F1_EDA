## Introduction

This project aims to perform data analytics on F1 data to uncover interesting insights and trends. The notebook covers various aspects of the data, including race results, driver performance, and more.

## Data Source

The F1 data used in this analysis is sourced from [insert data source here, e.g., a specific API, dataset link, etc.].

## Analysis Overview

The Jupyter notebook includes the following analyses:
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations of Key Metrics
- Statistical Analysis

## Installation

To run the notebook locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/F1-Data-Analytics.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd F1-Data-Analytics
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Open the `F1_Data_Analytics.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to reproduce the analysis.

## Results

The notebook provides insights and visualizations for:
- Race results and positions
- Driver performance over time
- Comparison of different teams
- Various other interesting metrics
